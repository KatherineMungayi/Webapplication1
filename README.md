# Webapplication1
The first web application I made as I was learning the trades of web application development.

It is a food website/blog which mainly has two kinds of users.A client and an admin.
When they each log in respectively they are each taken to different pages because they each have different functionalities in the system.
When the admin logs in,they are taken to a page where they have an option of altering user details such as deleting a user from the system upon request or editing user details in case of a change.They can lso add,edit and remove recipes from the system and place items on order for sale.
The user lands on the main page as soon as login is successful and they are able to view recipes and make orders on items available for sale i the system.
This web application requires a javascript enabled web browser to run.
